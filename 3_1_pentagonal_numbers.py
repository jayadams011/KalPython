# (Math: pentagonal numbers) A pentagonal number is defined as n(3n-1)/2 for and so on. So, the first
# few numbers are 1, 5, 12, 22, .... Write a function with the following header that returns a
# pentagonal number:

def getPentagonalNumber(n):
    for row in range(0,10):
        for col in range(0,10):
            pentagonalNumber = n(3n-1)/2
            print pentgonalNumber
